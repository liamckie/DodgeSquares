**Note** : These requirements are already installed within the project in a folder called "venv" which stands for virtual environment. Please read on to read how to run the project.

## How to run this project?
Once the project is downloaded and open in your chosen code editor, open a terminal either in the code editor or your computer terminal and if your in the code editor terminal then you should already be in the project directory and so all you need to do, if your code editor hasn't already changed into the "venv" directory is to type the command `'venv/Scripts/activate'` to activate the virtual environment and then run the python file by either clicking on the play button or in the code editor terminal type `'python DodgeSquareGame.py'`.

 If you are using the computer terminal then you will need to change to the project's directory yourself, once in the project's directory then use the command `'venv\Scripts\activate.bat'` to activate the virtual environment. Then type `'python DodgeSquareGame.py'` to run the python file.
